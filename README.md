# Learn-Responsive-Web-Design-by-Building-a-Piano.

This project is a simple, responsive piano interface created using HTML and CSS. It displays a set of piano keys styled to resemble an actual keyboard, with white and black keys arranged accurately. This project is perfect for learning about CSS layout techniques, responsive design, and visual styling.

## Features

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsiveness

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To view this project, you only need a web browser that supports HTML5 and CSS3.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files.
  
2. **Open the project folder** and double-click the `index.html` file to view the piano interface in your browser.

### Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that contains the structure of the piano keys.
- `styles.css` - The CSS file for styling the piano keys, layout, and responsive design.

## Usage

- Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the piano interface.
- The layout and size of the piano will adjust based on the screen size.

## Responsive Design

- For screens **768px or smaller**, the piano resizes for better viewing on mobile devices.
- For screens **between 769px and 1199px**, the piano adapts for medium-sized displays.
- On **large screens (1200px and above)**, the piano maintains a fixed width for optimal desktop viewing.

## Future Enhancements

Some ideas for further development include:
- Adding audio functionality to play sounds when keys are clicked.
- Enhancing styling with animations or effects when keys are pressed.
- Extending the keyboard to cover more octaves.
